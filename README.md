This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the CMD instruction fails because the application doesn't define a start script in the package.json. The Dockerfile uses a simple node application, which fails to start without explicitly declaring the start command in the package.json or in the dockerfile itself. The solution provides a corrected Dockerfile and a modified package.json to resolve the issue.
